LOGIC :
So basically we are maintaining two arrays , one for storing the game pattern given by System (Here generated using random module in javascript) & other one for storing user input 

So what we basically are doing is , Everytime the System suggests next color to User , we are resetting the userPattern array , when user is clicking the colors , we are filling it , simulatanously we are checking each filled color in userPattern array with gamePattern array , here index is crucial , as we need to check colors in sequence as system have generated them.

for it , we are always checking the last element index from userPattern array , as we are filling it everytime .So we get the correct index to be compared upon from both the arrays.

At any instant we get wrong ans , we suggest that and restart game after user input for the same.
While checking , we check until sizes of both arrays are equal and then only system gives next color .

This provides ample time for user to memorize the pattern.






//SOME CONCEPTS :
